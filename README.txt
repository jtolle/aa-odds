Files for playing around with battle odds for Axis and Allies and Fortress America

Goals:
 - calculated probabilities for real game situations
 - simulated battles to test calculated odds
 - dust off old Python skills

Initial code is just playing with toy cases. None of it is likely to stay.

What's here now:
 - Simplest case you can't run in your head - 2 infantry vs. 1 infantry, calc'd and sim'd
 - Sim for slightly more complex case of land battles including "new edition" artillery rules
 - Ancient calculator I wrote in 1995 to first learn C++...
    - ...it really was the first code I wrote after Hello World and you can tell
    - ...I was determined to overload me some operators!

Plans:
 - Calc'd version for land battles using the same basic algorithm as before
 - Markov Chain based algorithm which would probably make encoding new rules easier...
    - ...should be no problem on a modern computer
